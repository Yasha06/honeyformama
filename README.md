**Honey for Mom** is a web-based e-commerce project developed for a Web Programming course. It serves as a digital storefront for a craft honey brand, offering a cozy and user-friendly experience for purchasing natural honey products.

The project goes beyond a simple landing page by implementing full shopping cart logic, order processing simulation, and interactive content for honey lovers.

## Features

- **Dynamic Shopping Cart:** A fully functional cart system based on Flask Sessions. Users can add items, update quantities, and remove products without losing data upon page refresh.
- **Smart Recipe Calculator:** An interactive feature on recipe pages that automatically recalculates ingredient proportions based on the selected number of servings, ensuring culinary accuracy.
- **Digital Receipt Generation:** After confirming an order, the system generates a stylized "paper-like" receipt in the browser, which users can save as a PDF or print directly using the `window.print()` functionality.
- **Interactive Checkout:** A comprehensive checkout form with validation and modal windows for "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy", ensuring a professional user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with **Bootstrap 5**, the website is fully optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
